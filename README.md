BonziWORLD 2 Revived+ was the official BonziWORLD respiratory. It should be part of BWR franchise officially.

All the source code for the server and client is publically available here. If you want to run BonziWORLD 2, by all means go ahead.
Do whatever you'd like with this code. Just try to put me somewhere in the credits.
